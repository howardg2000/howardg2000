## Hi, I’m Howie
I'm an applied math and computer science major working towards a bachelor's and concurrent master's degree.
I'm interested in product engineering, data science, and applied machine learning. I've done a variety of
projects, from helping build a python eyetracking data analysis library, to extending OpenAI's gym taxi environment,
and making my own game for a final project. 

Currently working on a robinhood trading bot and pokernow statistics calculator!
